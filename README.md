## Clifford Reference 
This repository contains a (mostly) direct port of the Java reference 
implementation from http://www.geometricalgebra.net/reference_impl.html
The ported Java reference implementation was written by 
Leo Dorst, Daniel Fontijne and Stephen Mann and released to support their
excellent book, "Geometric Algebra for Computer Science (An object oriented
approach to Geometry)".  If you have the means, we recommend you pick up
the book from http://www.geometricalgebra.net/

We are working on a refactored, more typesafe and more efficent version of
this library.  When it is finished, we will publish a link to it here.
